He has also been deeply involved in the intersection of music and technology since the earliest days of the internet.Rennie began his music career working as a booking agent at USC. After dropping out of college in 1980 he decided to start his own concert promotion company called Steve Rennie Presents after being passed over for a job in the mailroom at William Morris because he had not completed college. For the next 2 1/2 years he promoted a number of up and coming 'new wave' bands including the Motels, The Plimsouls, Adam Ant, X, the Blasters, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and INXS in secondary markets outside LA.
